	Lab 4 Part 1 - Caleb Amadoro
	My code is overall very simple and straightforward. I initially declare the LED's as outputs and the buttons as inputs. I use TimerB0 and Timer B1 in this code. Timer B0 and B1 are both initialized using SMCLK in continuous mode with interrupts enabled, and both their CCRX values are as follows. CCR0 = 1000, CCR1 = 500. CCR0 is used for setting the period (1khz) and CCR1 is used for setting the duty cyle (50%). I create interupt vectors for the port 2 button and port 4 button. When 2.3 is pressed the duty cycle is increased by 100 (10%) until it reaches 100%. Once it reaches 100% it resets back to 0% on the next button press. The 4.1 button does the same thing just for a seperate timer. Ther interupt routines at the botton turn the button off when CCR1 is hit and back on when CCR0 is hit.
